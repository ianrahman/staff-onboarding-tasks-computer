# General Onboarding - Tasks

Do these things.

### On your first day

- Write a bio for the [team page on the wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/Team), and introduce yourself by emailing the link to team@! You **must** do this on your first day! 

- Introduce yourself to other employees in person (because not everybody reads their emails).

- Send Mike Linshi information to be published on our [team page](http://flatironschool.com/team):
  - A picture of you
  - A link to any web presences you want to link to (e.g. GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter)
  - Note: If you are an instructor, please also send a quote and a short bio. You can see the "instructors" section    of our [web](http://flatironschool.com/web) and [iOS](http://flatironschool.com/ios) pages for examples.

- [Memorize various codes](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/11+Broadway+resources).

### On any day
